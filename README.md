## LEARNING PLAN

1. A path finder using the A* search algorithm
	1. Build Finder Using Plan C++
		1. Understand how the A* algorithm works
			1. List and study in summary the prerequisites to learning A*
				1. Basic Math
					1. [Graph Theory Summary](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/grids/graphs.html)
					2. Cordinate Geometry
					3. Euclidean and Manhattan distances
				2. Algorithmic thinking
					1. Recursion
					2. DFS
					3. BFS
					4. [Djikstra](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html#python-dijkstra)
				3. Data structures basics
					1. Priority Queues
					2. Hash Maps
					3. Sets
				4. [Heuristics Understanding](https://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html)
					1. Admissible and Inadmissible Heuristics
					2. Consistence in heuristics
					3. How 11 and 12 ensure optimality
			2. Studying the A* Algo
				1. Watch a video and read and article on the algo
					1. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TsL96NAZCo) 
					2. [Article](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)
		2. [Implement Algo Solo](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html)
			1. [Python Implementation](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html#python)
				1. Write pseudo for python algo implementation
				2. Figure out and study which data structures will be needed for implementation if not studied yet
				3. Write modular function structure
				4. Implement and run
			2. [C++ Implementation]
				1. Write pseudo for C++ Implementation, could use `1.2.1.1`
				2. List data structs that'll be needed and study what you can't use so far
					1. Keep open tabs to tutorials on data structs you can't use
				3. Create modular code structure for pseudo implementation
				4. Implement algo and run
2. A visualisation of it using python pygame
	1. Familiarize self with implementing visualizer components using pygame
		1. Grid
		2. Changing cell colors
		3. Setting titles
	2. Learn about getting C++ to communicate with Python
	3. Implement 1.2.2.4 output using pygame
